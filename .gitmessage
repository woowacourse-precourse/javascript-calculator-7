#=================#


# Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

## Subject line
# Subject line contains succinct description of the change.

# Allowed `<type>` 
# feat (feature)
# fix (bug fix)
# docs (documentation)
# style (formatting, missing semi colons, …)
# refactor
# test (when adding missing tests)
# chore (maintain)

# Allowed `<scope>`
# Scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example $location, $browser, $compile, $rootScope, ngHref, ngClick, ngView, etc...

# `<subject>` text
# - use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
# - don't capitalize first letter
# - no dot (.) at the end

## Message body
# - just as in <subject> use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
# - includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

## Message footer

# Breaking changes
# All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the description of the change, justification and migration notes

# ```
# BREAKING CHANGE: isolate scope bindings definition has changed and
#     the inject option for the directive controller injection was removed.
# 
#     To migrate the code follow the example below:
# 
#     Before:
# 
#     scope: {
#       myAttr: 'attribute',
#       myBind: 'bind',
#       myExpression: 'expression',
#       myEval: 'evaluate',
#       myAccessor: 'accessor'
#     }
# 
#     After:
# 
#     scope: {
#       myAttr: '@',
#       myBind: '@',
#       myExpression: '&',
#       // myEval - usually not useful, but in cases where the expression is assignable, you can use '='
#       myAccessor: '=' // in directive's template change myAccessor() to myAccessor
#     }
# 
#     The removed `inject` wasn't generaly useful for directives so there should be no code using it.
# ```

# Referencing issues
# Closed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword like this:

# ```
# Closes #234
# ```
# 
# or in case of multiple issues:
# 
# ```
# Closes #123, #245, #992
# ```

## Example

# ```
# feat($browser): onUrlChange event (popstate/hashchange/polling)
# 
# Added new event to $browser:
# - forward popstate event if available
# - forward hashchange event if popstate not available
# - do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available
# 
# Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)
# ```
# 
# ```
# fix($compile): couple of unit tests for IE9
# 
# Older IEs serialize html uppercased, but IE9 does not...
# Would be better to expect case insensitive, unfortunately jasmine does
# not allow to user regexps for throw expectations.
# 
# Closes #392
# Breaks foo.bar api, foo.baz should be used instead
# ```
# 
# ```
# feat(directive): ng:disabled, ng:checked, ng:multiple, ng:readonly, ng:selected
# 
# New directives for proper binding these attributes in older browsers (IE).
# Added coresponding description, live examples and e2e tests.
# 
# Closes #351
# ```
# 
# ```
# style($location): add couple of missing semi colons
# ```
# 
# ```
# docs(guide): updated fixed docs from Google Docs
# 
# Couple of typos fixed:
# - indentation
# - batchLogbatchLog -> batchLog
# - start periodic checking
# - missing brace
# ```
# 
# ```
# feat($compile): simplify isolate scope bindings
# 
# Changed the isolate scope binding options to:
#   - @attr - attribute binding (including interpolation)
#   - =model - by-directional model binding
#   - &expr - expression execution binding
# 
# This change simplifies the terminology as well as
# number of choices available to the developer. It
# also supports local name aliasing from the parent.
# 
# BREAKING CHANGE: isolate scope bindings definition has changed and
# the inject option for the directive controller injection was removed.
# 
# To migrate the code follow the example below:
# 
# Before:
# 
# scope: {
#   myAttr: 'attribute',
#   myBind: 'bind',
#   myExpression: 'expression',
#   myEval: 'evaluate',
#   myAccessor: 'accessor'
# }
# 
# After:
# 
# scope: {
#   myAttr: '@',
#   myBind: '@',
#   myExpression: '&',
#   // myEval - usually not useful, but in cases where the expression is assignable, you can use '='
#   myAccessor: '=' // in directive's template change myAccessor() to myAccessor
# }
# 
# The removed `inject` wasn't generaly useful for directives so there should be no code using it.
